# Bug Game
frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

## Situation:

Learn OOJ via creating objects and functions to make a Frogger Game clone.
##Objective:

The game runs on a loop that connects and renders the images once all of the objects and related methods have been created in app.js.

## Action:

Take the OOJ and HTML5Canvas Class.

Understand comments in engine.js and resources.js.

Create empty functions in app.js to render images.

Use Math.random to add randomness.

Create loop that renders enemy bugs on and off the screen.

Write input handlers so player moves across the screen and stays on stage.

Reset player when he reaches the water.

Reset player when he collides with an enemy bug.





## Result:

A game where the player has to get to the other side of the stage without getting hit by an enemy bug.

The player will reset to the start position if hit by a bug or if the player reaches the other side.
